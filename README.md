## We used semantic HTML and accessibility practices to boost search engine optimization and to meet accessibility standards for the client. 

Step By Step: 
1. Replaced all of the "div" elements with Semantic HTML elements. 
2. Created accessible alt attributes for images. 
3. Put navigation bar elements in sequential order.
4. Created concise, descriptive title element.
